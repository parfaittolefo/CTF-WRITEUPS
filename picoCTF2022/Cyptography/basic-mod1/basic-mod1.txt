Description
We found this weird message being passed around on the servers, we think we have a working decrpytion scheme.
Download the message here.
Take each number mod 37 and map it to the following character set: 0-25 is the alphabet (uppercase), 26-35 are the decimal digits, and 36 is an underscore.
Wrap your decrypted message in the picoCTF flag format (i.e. picoCTF{decrypted_message})

Hints:

1 - Do you know what mod 37 means?

2- mod 37 means modulo 37. It gives the remainder of a number after being divided by 37.
