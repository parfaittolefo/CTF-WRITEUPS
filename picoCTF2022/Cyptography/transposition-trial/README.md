**Description**

Our data got corrupted on the way here. Luckily, nothing got replaced, but every block of 3 got scrambled around! The first word seems to be three letters long, maybe you can use that to recover the rest of the message.

Hint: 

Split the message up into blocks of 3 and see how the first block is scrambled
