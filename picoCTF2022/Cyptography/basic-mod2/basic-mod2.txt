A new modular challenge!

Take each number mod 41 and find the modular inverse for the result. Then map to the following character set: 1-26 are the alphabet, 27-36 are the decimal digits, and 37 is an underscore.
Wrap your decrypted message in the picoCTF flag format (i.e. picoCTF{decrypted_message})

Hints:

1- Do you know what the modular inverse is?

2- The inverse modulo z of x is the number, y that when multiplied by x is 1 modulo z

3- It's recommended to use a tool to find the modular inverses
